In this study we just use  Sales.SalesOrderHeder table  and filter to United State (US) market, which consists of 12041order records to get RFM values, 
The table has fieilds such as SalesOrderID (primary key), OrderDate (Date the sales order was created), CustomerID (Cutomer identification number who had ordered) 
SubTotal (Computed as Sum(UnitPrice * (1 - UnitPriceDiscount) * OrderQty) for the appropriate SalesOrderID), TerritoryID (Territory in which the sale was made, which TerritoryID between 1 and 5 are United States market)
We use SQL query to calculate Frequency, Recency, Monetary for each customer base on table above as view. After that, we export to excel for analysis.

Some SQL queries we used to get Frequency, Recency and Monetary for each customer such as:

/* Getting Frequency, Requency, Monetary from Sales.SalesOrderHeader table
in case of customers are in US  and save to RFM_US view */
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW RFM_US AS
SELECT CustomerID, DATEDIFF(DAY, MAX(OrderDate), (SELECT MAX(OrderDate) FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader)) + 1 AS 'Recency', 
COUNT(SalesOrderNumber) AS 'Frequency', SUM(SubTotal) AS 'Monetary'
FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
WHERE TerritoryID BETWEEN 1 AND 5
GROUP BY CustomerID

/* Join Sales.SalesOrderHeader, Sales.SalesOrderDetail to get product and quantity  each SalesOrderID */
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW INVOICE_DATASET AS
SELECT H.CustomerID, H.SalesOrderNumber, H.OrderDate, D.OrderQty, D.UnitPrice, D.ProductID
FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader H JOIN Sales.SalesOrderDetail D ON H.SalesOrderID = D.SalesOrderID
WHERE H.TerritoryID BETWEEN 1 AND 5
